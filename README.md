## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### Continued development

- I need to work on thinking about how everything works together more, e.g. checkbox state could've been combined with their respective character lists, labels, etc. to make creating objects and using in functions easier to adjust

### Useful resources

- [Custom Checkbox](https://medium.com/@colebemis/building-a-checkbox-component-with-react-and-styled-components-8d3aa1d826dd) Custom checkbox styling
